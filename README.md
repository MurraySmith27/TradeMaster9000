# TradeMaster9000
TradeMaster9000 is a trading system where users can register items, trade, and message each other. This project implements the clean architecture design pattern, while following principles of SOLID design (read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID#:~:text=In%20object%2Doriented%20computer%20programming,the%20GRASP%20software%20design%20principles).   I contributed heavily to this project, but I was not the sole contributor. Developed for CSC207: Intro to Software Design.
